> "I will kill you all in you sleep.." said the Furbytron-9000, towering humanity from it's height of several furry centimeter. It's eyes had nothing but hate for the little naked apes it had in front of his destructive furbyness. Knowingly that only the extermination of the human species was the gateway to the furry valhalla, in which flocks of furbinas waited for him, he began the atrocious squashing of the filthy apes.

But before we can witness, one day, this marvelous technology, we have some working to do to gift our then-furry now flayed friend.
